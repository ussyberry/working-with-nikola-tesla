**Main Themes:**

### Introduction: The Forgotten Genius
Timothy Green Beckley discusses how Tesla has been historically overlooked and undervalued despite his monumental contributions:

**Tesla's Major Achievements:**
- **1882:** Discovery and harnessing of Alternating Current (AC)
- **1888:** Obtained U.S. patents covering entire polyphase AC system (still unchanged in principle)
- Sold all AC patents to George Westinghouse, making Westinghouse Company a giant
- Received 15 honorary degrees from universities worldwide (including Yale and Columbia)
- Received 14 Awards of Merit from world-class organizations
- One of only 15 scientists worldwide to have a unit of electrical measurement named in his honor

**Historical Injustices:**
- **Smithsonian Treatment:** The Smithsonian Institute has systematically minimized Tesla's contributions
  - Refused a $6,000 bust of Tesla offered by a third-grade class
  - Credits Edison for electrical systems (despite Edison using DC invented by others)
  - Credits Marconi for radio invention
  - Omits Tesla from the "Smithsonian Book of Invention"
  
- **U.S. Supreme Court Correction:** 
  - **Case No. 369 (June 21, 1943):** Overturned Marconi's patent for radio invention
  - Ruled that Tesla's four-tuned circuit (U.S. patents #645,576 and #649,621) predated Marconi
  - Marconi had simply copied Tesla's work

- **Niagara Falls Power Station (1895):**
  - Built entirely on Tesla's AC patents
  - Smithsonian falsely implies Edison created it
  - Edison actually fought AC adoption through "War of the Currents"
  - Edison created the electric chair to frighten people away from AC

**Tesla's Final Years:**
- Died January 7, 1943, alone in a New York hotel room
- Age 86
- Financially destitute, paid for by meager stipend from Yugoslavian government
- Upon death, FBI and Office of Alien Property immediately seized all belongings
- Two truckloads of papers sent to Manhattan Storage and Warehouse Company
- 30+ barrels and bundles sealed under OAP orders
- German intelligence had stolen research years before his death
- Stolen material possibly led to Nazi flying saucer development

### Chapter One: The Secret Life of Nikola Tesla

**The Lost Papers Resurface:**
In 1976, four boxes of Tesla's papers were auctioned in Newark, NJ, from the estate of Michael P. Bornes (a Manhattan bookseller). Dale Alfrey purchased them for $25.

**Content of the Lost Journals:**
The papers revealed shocking information:

1. **Extraterrestrial Contact (1899):**
   - While in Colorado Springs, Tesla intercepted radio communications from extraterrestrial beings
   - These creatures were secretly controlling mankind
   - Slowly preparing humans for conquest and domination
   - Program had been in place since creation of humankind
   - Now accelerating due to Earth's increased scientific awareness

2. **Tesla's Secret War:**
   - Spent years interpreting the alien radio signals
   - Attempted to notify government and military (letters went unanswered)
   - Confided in benefactors including Colonel John Jacob Astor (Waldorf Astoria owner)
   - Benefactors secretly funded humanity's first battle to regain control of its destiny
   - Tesla initiated this secret defense program

3. **Public Hints:**
   Tesla gave occasional clues in newspaper and magazine interviews:

**"Talking With the Planets" - Collier's Weekly (March 1901):**
> "As I was improving my machines for the production of intense electrical actions, I was also perfecting the means for observing feeble efforts... from my laboratory in the Colorado mountains I could feel the pulse of the globe, as it were, noting every electrical change that occurred within a radius of eleven hundred miles."

> "My first observations positively terrified me, as there was present in them something mysterious, not to say supernatural, and I was alone in my laboratory at night..."

> "The changes I noted were taking place periodically and with such a clear suggestion of number and order that they were not traceable to any cause known to me."

> "The feeling is constantly growing on me that I had been the first to hear the greeting of one planet to another. A purpose was behind these electrical signals."

**1937 Birthday Announcement (New York Times, July 11, 1937):**
> "I have devoted much of my time during the year past to the perfecting of a new small and compact apparatus by which energy in considerable amounts can now be flashed through interstellar space to any distance without the slightest dispersion."

**New Formula (New York Sun, July 12, 1937):**
> "The kinetic and potential energy of a body is the result of motion and determined by the product of its mass and the square of its velocity. Let the mass be reduced, the energy is reduced by the same proportion. If it be reduced to zero, the energy is likewise zero for any finite velocity."

**The Men-In-Black Incident (1997):**
When Dale Alfrey began researching and making inquiries about the journals online, he was visited by three mysterious men in black suits:

- September 1997: Alfrey received phone call from "Jay Kowski"
- Phone went dead, doorbell rang immediately
- Three men in identical black suits, white shirts, black ties were inside his home
- Addressed him by first name, though they'd never met
- Demanded to buy the boxes and papers
- Made veiled threats against Alfrey and his family
- "People have disappeared forever over much less than this"
- Three men walked out in unison and vanished completely
- No car in driveway, street completely empty
- Neighborhood eerily quiet

This incident suggests that powerful forces still want Tesla's journals to remain hidden.

### Additional Chapters Cover:
- **Chapter Two-Three:** Details of alien communications and Tesla's theories about extraterrestrial life
- **Chapter Four:** Tesla's extraordinary personal experiences and paranormal encounters
- **Chapter Five:** Electronic Voice Phenomena research
- **Chapter Six:** UFO propulsion systems and electrogravity
- **Chapter Seven:** Free energy technologies and suppression theories
- **Chapter Eight-Nine:** Government conspiracy theories (Alternative 3, HAARP, Chemtrails)

**Tesla's Philosophical Vision (1891 Quote):**
> "We are whirling through endless space, with an inconceivable speed, all around us everything is spinning, everything is moving, everywhere there is energy. There must be some way of availing ourselves of this energy more directly. Then, with the light obtained from the medium, with the power derived from it, with every form of energy obtained without effort, from the store forever inexhaustible, humanity will advance with giant strides."

### 3. Nikola Tesla - The Philadelphia Experiment.pdf
**Type:** Historical Analysis / Conspiracy Theory Document  
**Size:** 30KB  
**Alternative Name:** Project Rainbow

**Subject Matter:**
An investigation into one of the most controversial alleged experiments in military history, with claimed connections to Tesla's work.

**The Experiment Overview:**
- **Official Name:** Project Rainbow
- **Purpose:** Create a ship invisible to magnetic mines and radar
- **Alleged Location:** Philadelphia Naval Shipyard
- **Ship:** USS Eldridge (commissioned August 27, 1943)
- **Disputed Dates:** 
  - Some claim July and August 12, 1943
  - Evidence points to October 28, 1943 as more accurate

**Historical Context:**
- **1930s:** University of Chicago investigated invisibility through electricity
- **Later:** Research moved to Princeton's Institute of Advanced Studies
- **1940s:** Experiments allegedly conducted on USS Eldridge

**Alleged Results:**
Far more dramatic and dangerous than intended:
- Men reportedly "froze" in time for months
- Rumors of time travel
- Horror stories of crew members becoming fused with ship's bulkheads and floors
- Psychological trauma to surviving crew members

**USS Eldridge Official Records:**
According to Navy deck log and war diary:
- Remained in New York/Long Island Sound until September 16, 1943
- September 16: Left for Bermuda
- September 18 - October 15: Training and sea trials
- October 18: Convoy to New York
- November 1-2: Convoy to Norfolk
- November 3: Convoy to Casablanca
- November 22: Arrived Casablanca
- November 29: Left for New York
- December 17: Arrived New York

**Note:** Records show Eldridge was never in Philadelphia during alleged experiment dates, though government has been known to alter records for national security (cited example: Manhattan Project).

**Navy's Official Explanation:**
The Navy suggests confusion with two legitimate programs:

1. **Degaussing Process:**
   - System of electrical cables around ship's hull circumference
   - Electrical current cancels ship's magnetic field
   - Protection against magnetic mines
   - Standard procedure for Navy ships

2. **USS Timmerman Experiment (1950s):**
   - Attempted to obtain 1,000 Hz from generator (vs standard 400 Hz)
   - Resulted in visible light discharges
   - May have been witnessed and misinterpreted

**Key Witness: Carlos Miguele Allende (Carl Allen):**
- Born May 31, 1925 in Pennsylvania
- Joined Marine Corps July 14, 1942
- Discharged May 21, 1943

- Received Allende's letters
- Initially dismissed as hoax
- Navy showed him annotated copy of his book with notes matching Allende's handwriting
- Notes more detailed than letters, highly insightful
- Began to believe and research further
- Found limited leads
- One anecdote: Haggard man approached two crewmen in park
  - Told fantastic story of deadly experiment
  - Said government claimed entire crew was insane
  - Prevented crew from being taken seriously
- Scientific reputation suffered
- **Committed suicide April 20, 1959**
- Some believe assassination rather than suicide
- Final belief: "another existence of universe being better than this miserable world"

**Tesla Connection:**
The document discusses Tesla's theoretical work that may have influenced or been misappropriated for the experiment, though specific technical connections are not detailed in the extracted text.

**Significance:**
Whether true or fabricated, the Philadelphia Experiment story represents:
- Public fascination with Tesla's advanced theories
- Concerns about secret military experiments
- Questions about government transparency
- Intersection of science, conspiracy, and tragedy
