### 3. Tesla Turbine.pdf
**Type:** Technical News Report / Patent-Related Documentation  
**Pages:** Multiple pages with photographs  
**Published by:** Creative Science & Research (Document #393)

**Description:**
A news report and technical documentation about the Tesla Turbine, featuring photographs of customer-built turbines. This document covers one of Tesla's mechanical inventions - a bladeless turbine design.

**Key Features of Tesla Turbine:**
- Revolutionary bladeless design
- Uses smooth parallel disks instead of conventional blades
- Fluid flows in spiral pattern between disks
- Based on boundary layer effect and viscous drag
- Simple construction with fewer moving parts

**Historical Context:**
The Tesla turbine represented a radical departure from conventional turbine design. Unlike traditional turbines with blades or vanes, Tesla's design used smooth, flat disks mounted on a shaft with small spacing between them. Fluid (steam, water, or air) enters tangentially and spirals inward, propelling the disks through viscous forces.

**Advantages:**
- Simpler construction than bladed turbines
- Fewer parts, potentially more reliable
- Can handle various working fluids
- Efficient at certain operating ranges
- Less susceptible to damage from particulates

**Practical Applications:**
- Steam power generation
- Compressed air motors
- Water pumps
- Experimental power systems
- Educational demonstrations

**Document Contents:**
- Customer-submitted photographs showing real implementations
- Demonstrates continued interest in Tesla's mechanical designs
- Evidence of modern builders recreating historical inventions
